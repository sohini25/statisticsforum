<h3>DATA DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>We begin with a simple example. There are millions of passenger automobiles in the United States. What is their average value? It is obviously impractical to attempt to solve this problem directly by assessing the value of every single car in the country, adding up all those numbers, and then dividing by however many numbers there are. Instead, the best we can do would be to estimate the average. One natural way to do so would be to randomly select some of the cars, say 200 of them, ascertain the value of each of those cars, and find the average of those 200 numbers. The set of all those millions of vehicles is called the population of interest, and the number attached to each one, its value, is a measurement. The average value is a parameter: a number that describes a characteristic of the population, in this case monetary worth. The set of 200 cars selected from the population is called a sample, and the 200 numbers, the monetary values of the cars we selected, are the sample data. The average of the data is called a statistic: a number calculated from the sample data. This example illustrates the meaning of the following definitions.</p>
<strong> keywords: </strong>
<ol>
<li>A <strong>population</strong> is any specific collection of objects of interest. A <strong>sample</strong> is any subset or subcollection of the population, including the case that the sample consists of the whole population, in which case it is termed a census.</li>
<li>A <strong>measurement</strong> is a number or attribute computed for each member of a population or of a sample. The measurements of sample elements are collectively called the <strong>sample data</strong>.</li>
<li>A <strong>parameter</strong> is a number that summarizes some aspect of the population as a whole. A statistic is a number computed from the sample data.</li>
<p>Continuing with our example, if the average value of the cars in our sample was $8,357, then it seems reasonable to conclude that the average value of all cars is about $8,357. In reasoning this way we have drawn an inference about the population based on information obtained from the sample. In general, statistics is a study of data: describing properties of the data, which is called descriptive statistics, and drawing conclusions about a population of interest from information extracted from a sample, which is called inferential statistics. Computing the single number $8,357 to summarize the data was an operation of descriptive statistics; using it to make a statement about the population was an operation of inferential statistics.</p>
<li><strong>Statistics is a collection of methods for collecting, displaying, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> is the branch of statistics that involves organizing, displaying, and describing data.Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that involves drawing conclusions about a population based on information contained in a sample taken from that population.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<p>The measurement made on each element of a sample need not be numerical. In the case of automobiles, what is noted about each car could be its color, its make, its body type, and so on. Such data are categorical or qualitative, as opposed to numerical or quantitative data such as value or age. This is a general distinction.</p>
<li><strong>Qualitative data</strong> are measurements for which there is no natural numerical scale, but which consist of attributes, labels, or 
other nonnumerical characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Quantitative </strong>data are numerical measurements that arise from a natural numerical scale.</li>
<p> <strong>Lets discuss these in details</strong></p>
</ol>
<p><br><strong>QUALITATIVE DATA</br></strong><br>
Qualitative data, also known as Categorical Data, basically delivers information about the quality of things in data. Qualitative data can be arranged categorically based on the attributes and properties of a thing or a phenomenon.
The colour, shape, complexion, or anything that defines the quality of things together constitute Qualitative Data. Qualitative Analysis is generally used by statisticians to understand behaviours, for example how a customer feels about a product or service and what qualities of a product are they motivated by.
Qualitative data can be collected by Interviews, observations, focus groups, document study etc.<br>
<br><strong>QUANTITATIVE DATA</br></strong><br>
Quantitative Data, also known as Numerical Data simply gives information about quantities of items in the data and the items that can be estimated. Quantitative data is basically number based, countable, or measurable.
Height, weight, age all these can be considered as major examples of Quantitative Data. 
Let us understand the difference between Qualitative and Quantitative Data like this, suppose you want to describe your younger sister. You might describe her physical appearance, her height, weight, hobbies, personality etc. All these data will fall either into either of the two categories. The height, weight, age of your sister, the distance of your sister’s school from her house, the number of pens she has in her pencil box, the number of dresses she has, all these will fall under Quantitative Data. On the other hand, your sister has curly black hair, with a fair complexion, the colour of you sister’s spectacles, the type of voice she has(loud or low), the colour of her pencil box all these will fall under Qualitative Data.

<h3>GENERATING FUNCTIONS</h3>

</header>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>In mathematics, a generating function is a way of encoding an infinite sequence of numbers (an) by treating them as the coefficients of a formal power series. 
This series is called the generating function of the sequence. Unlike an ordinary series, the formal power series is not required to converge: 
in fact, the generating function is not actually regarded as a function, and the "variable" remains an indeterminate. 
Generating functions were first introduced by Abraham de Moivre in 1730, in order to solve the general linear recurrence problem. 
One can generalize to formal power series in more than one indeterminate, to encode information about infinite multi-dimensional arrays of numbers.
<br></br>
There are various types of generating functions, including ordinary generating functions, exponential generating functions, 
Lambert series, Bell series, and Dirichlet series; definitions and examples are given below. 
Every sequence in principle has a generating function of each type (except that Lambert and Dirichlet series require indices to start at 1 rather than 0), 
but the ease with which they can be handled may differ considerably. The particular generating function, if any, that is most useful in a given context 
will depend upon the nature of the sequence and the details of the problem being addressed.</p>
<p><strong> WHAT IS A GENERATING FUNCTION:</strong></p>
<p>Let〖  {a〗_n} be a sequence of real numbers. The generating function of 〖 {a〗_n} is defined as 
A(t) = ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖  a〗_(n )  t^(n ) 
Provided that the series converges absolutely for any real number t such that |t| < 〖 t〗_0 
For example, we can take 〖  {a〗_n} = 1
A(t) = 1 + t + t^(2 ) +…… = 1/(1 – t) ,where |t|<1
</p>
<ol>
<p> Now coming to the types of generating functions:</p>

<li> <strong>Probability Generating Function:</strong> Let X be a discrete random variable with mass points n = 0,1,2,…. And let p(n) = P(X = n) be the mass function . Then the generating function of the sequence {p(n)} is called probability generating function or P.G.F of the random variable X and is denoted by 
                                                      P_X  (t)  =∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 t^(n ) , n = 0,1,2,…
<br> <br><strong > NOTE: </strong></br></br> |∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 t^(n ) | <=  ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 〖|t〗^(n )|  <= ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 〖|t|〗^(n ) <= ∑_(n=0 )^∞▒〖|t|〗^n  
We know that the geometric series ∑_(n=0 )^∞▒〖|t|〗^n   converges absolutely when |t| < 1
Then by comparison test we can say that ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 〖|t|〗^(n )  converges absolutely when |t| < 1
For |t| =1:
∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 〖|t|〗^(n )   = ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 = 1, then it is also convergent.
Therefore P_X  (t)   converges absolutely when |t|<=1
∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖p(n)〗 t^(n )   = E(t^X ) , |t|<= 1
<br><br> <strong> USES: </strong></br></br>As the name suggests a P.G.F gives the probability corresponding to the mass points of the relevant discrete distribution i.e. the pmf of a discrete distribution.</li>
</ol>
<ol>

<p> <strong><h3>Lets discuss the results in details:</h3></strong></p>
</ol>
<p>The distribution of a discrete random variable X can be determined uniquely from its Generating function. 
Consider two random variables X and Y, taking non-negative integer values such that P(X = n) and P(Y = n).
Suppose X and Y have same generating function P(t)
Then P(t) = ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖P(X=n)〗 t^(n )   
And P(t) = ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖P(Y=n)〗 t^(n )        where |t|<=1
Therefore for all |t|<=1
∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖P(X=n)〗 t^(n )   = ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖P(Y=n)〗 t^(n )   
Comparing the coefficients of t^(n )   from both side of the above identity we get,
∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖P(X=n)〗  = ∑_(n=0)^∞▒〖P(Y=n)〗
P(X=n) = P(Y=n) which implies X = Y
Therefore X and Y have the same distribution. (Proved)
